# Event-Task System

The Event-Task system is the core operational mechanism in AITOS that enables asynchronous, decoupled processing. This design allows agents to respond to various triggers while maintaining a clean separation of concerns.

## Key Concepts

### Events

Events represent state changes or external triggers within the system. Every event in AITOS includes:

- **type**: A string identifier for the event category
- **payload**: Data associated with the event
- **description**: Human-readable description of the event
- **timestamp**: When the event occurred

```typescript
interface AgentEvent {
  type: string;
  payload?: any;
  description: string;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

Events can be emitted by any component that has access to a Sensing instance:

```typescript
agent.sensing.emitEvent({
  type: "UPDATE_PRICE_REQUEST",
  description: "Request to update asset price information",
  payload: { assets: ["BTC", "ETH"] },
  timestamp: Date.now(),
});
```

### Tasks

Tasks are units of work created in response to events. They include:

- **id**: Unique identifier (generated automatically)
- **type**: String identifier for the task category
- **description**: Human-readable description
- **payload**: Data needed to execute the task
- **callback**: Function to execute when the task runs
- **status**: Current state of the task ("pending", "running", "completed", "failed")

```typescript
interface AgentTask<TPayload = any> {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  description: string;
  payload: TPayload;
  createdAt: number;
  status: "pending" | "running" | "completed" | "failed";
  result?: any;
  callback?: (payload: TPayload) => any;
}
```

Tasks are created through the TaskManager:

```typescript
agent.taskManager.createTask({
  type: "PROCESS_PRICE_DATA",
  description: "Process received price data",
  payload: priceData,
  callback: async (data) => {
    // Process the data
    const result = await processData(data);
    return result;
  },
});
```

## Workflow

The Event-Task system follows this general workflow:

1. **Event Emission**: An event is published to the sensing layer
2. **Event Detection**: Listeners detect the event
3. **Task Creation**: A task is created in response to the event
4. **Task Execution**: The task executes asynchronously
5. **Result**: The task may emit new events upon completion

This creates a chain of events and tasks that drive the agent's behavior.

## Example: Basic Event-Task Flow

```typescript
// 1. Register a listener for a specific event type
agent.sensing.registerListener((evt) => {
  if (evt.type === "NEW_DATA_AVAILABLE") {
    console.log("New data detected, creating processing task");
    
    // 2. Create a task in response to the event
    agent.taskManager.createTask({
      type: "PROCESS_DATA_TASK",
      description: "Process newly available data",
      payload: evt.payload,
      callback: async (data) => {
        // 3. Process the data
        const processedResult = await processData(data);
        
        // 4. Emit a new event upon completion
        agent.sensing.emitEvent({
          type: "DATA_PROCESSING_COMPLETED",
          description: "Data has been processed successfully",
          payload: processedResult,
          timestamp: Date.now(),
        });
        
        return processedResult;
      },
    });
  }
});

// Later, trigger the flow by emitting an event
agent.sensing.emitEvent({
  type: "NEW_DATA_AVAILABLE",
  description: "New market data is available",
  payload: { source: "binance", data: [/* ... */] },
  timestamp: Date.now(),
});
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Event Filtering

You can filter events by type to handle specific categories:

```typescript
// Register a listener for only specific event types
agent.sensing.registerListener((evt) => {
  if (evt.type.startsWith("USER_")) {
    // Handle user-related events
  }
});
```

### Task Chaining

Tasks can be chained by having one task emit an event that triggers the next task:

```typescript
// Task 1
agent.taskManager.createTask({
  type: "FETCH_DATA",
  description: "Fetch data from API",
  callback: async () => {
    const data = await fetchFromAPI();
    
    // Emit event to trigger next task
    agent.sensing.emitEvent({
      type: "DATA_FETCHED",
      description: "Data has been fetched and is ready for processing",
      payload: data,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    });
    
    return data;
  },
});

// A separate listener sets up Task 2
agent.sensing.registerListener((evt) => {
  if (evt.type === "DATA_FETCHED") {
    agent.taskManager.createTask({
      type: "TRANSFORM_DATA",
      description: "Transform fetched data",
      payload: evt.payload,
      callback: (data) => {
        // Process the data
      },
    });
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Type Names**: Choose clear, action-oriented names for event types (e.g., "DATA_REQUESTED", "USER_AUTHENTICATED")

2. **Include Relevant Data**: Ensure event payloads contain all necessary data for tasks to execute without additional context

3. **Filter Appropriately**: Only create tasks for events that your module or agent should respond to

4. **Think in Flows**: Design your system in terms of event-task flows rather than direct function calls

5. **Log Important Transitions**: Consider logging when critical events are emitted or tasks are completed for debugging
