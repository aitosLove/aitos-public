# Framework Overview

AITOS is built on a modular, event-driven architecture designed to enable complex agent behaviors and multi-agent collaboration. This page provides a high-level overview of the key components that make up the AITOS framework.

## Core Components

The AITOS framework consists of several core components that work together to provide a flexible and powerful agent system:

### Agent

The `Agent` class is the central entity in the AITOS framework. It integrates several core modules:

- **sensing**: Event perception system
- **taskManager**: Task management
- **thinking**: Cognitive processing
- **state**: Status management
- **reflection**: Self-reflection capabilities
- **monitoring**: System monitoring

Each agent has a unique `agentId` and can have both a private sensing system for internal events and a shared group sensing system for multi-agent communication.

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  agentId: "my-agent-id", // Optional, will generate UUID if not provided
  name: "My Agent",       // Optional, defaults to "Agent-{first 8 chars of agentId}"
  groupSensing: sharedSensingInstance, // Optional, for multi-agent setups
});
```

### Sensing

The Sensing system serves as the event perception layer for agents. AITOS provides two types of sensing:

1. **Private Sensing** (`agent.sensing`): Each agent's private event bus for internal events
2. **Group Sensing** (`agent.groupSensing`): Shared event bus for multi-agent communication

Both implement the `ISensing` interface which provides methods for registering listeners and emitting events.

### Task Manager

The Task Manager handles the creation and execution of tasks within an agent. It provides:

- Task creation with automatic execution
- Task status tracking
- Task callback execution

Tasks are the unit of work in the AITOS system, responding to events and executing actions.

### Blueprints

Blueprints define reusable agent configurations, including which modules to enable and how they interact. They serve as templates for quickly setting up agents with specific capabilities.

### Modules

Modules provide specific functionalities that can be added to agents. Each module typically:

1. Registers listeners for specific events
2. Creates tasks in response to those events
3. Emits new events upon task completion

## System Architecture

AITOS follows an event-driven architecture where:

1. External or internal triggers emit events
2. Event listeners detect relevant events
3. Tasks are created in response to events
4. Task execution potentially creates new events

This creates a flexible, decoupled system where components communicate through events rather than direct function calls.
