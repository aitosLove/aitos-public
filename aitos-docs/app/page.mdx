# AITOS Framework

Welcome to the official documentation for AITOS, a sophisticated multi-agent framework designed with a focus on modularity, extensible blueprints, and a runtime-centric approach to agent instantiation.

## What is AITOS?

AITOS is a multi-agent system built around the concept of multiple agents that can communicate and collaborate. It incorporates an upgraded multi-agent communication mechanism called "group sensing" and emphasizes a modular structure that allows for clear separation and organization of different functionalities into "modules."

## Key Features

- **Event-Task Architecture**: Asynchronous operation through decoupled events and tasks
- **Module System**: Extensible functionality through plug-and-play modules
- **Blueprints**: Pre-defined agent configurations for common use cases
- **Group Sensing**: Advanced inter-agent communication mechanism
- **Runtime Instantiation**: Dynamic agent creation and configuration

## Getting Started

To start using AITOS, follow our [Quick Start Guide](/quick-start) to set up your first agent.
